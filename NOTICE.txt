This project is a fork. The source code is located here:
https://github.com/TomasJohansson/k-shortest-paths

The location of the original project:
https://github.com/bsmock/k-shortest-paths


The forked version has NOT modified the implementation of the algorithm.
The purpose of the fork was to make it into a Maven project to simplify reusage of it.

The location of the existing java packages was moved from the project root to the directory "src/main/java"
(i.e. as in the Maven standard directory structure).
Git commit: https://github.com/TomasJohansson/k-shortest-paths/commit/ce0dedf8e2786c3f558946b7218d370d0e75ecfd   

The only existing java file that has changed is the class "SimpleEppstein".
A reference to the missing interface "KSPAlgorithmCutoff" was removed to be able to compile.

The only new java file added to the fork compared with the original project is the class "YenTest"
It is doing anything meaningful but was added just as an example and to verify that "mvn test" works.
